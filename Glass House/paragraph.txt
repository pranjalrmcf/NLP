All alone in a glass house
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
M3 in the driveway
Caffeine for the heartache
Never wanna have it my way

Yeah, I fuck up and lose control
Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole
In my lungs, in my soul, in my denim coat
Same place I'ma keep that knife if I'ma slit my throat
This shit ugly, I was just with Nipsey, now he ghost
They even got my homie Pete out here, like, fuck the jokes
Damn

All alone in a glass house (Just keep it going)
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
Sometimes I wanna fucking scream or run away, I don't know
Ayy, life's been hard since seventeen
I've been through hell, I think I'm somewhere in-between
Caught in purgatory, I can paint the scene
Everything turned to a nightmare from a dream
Look, wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can't get that back
Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I miss my homie Mac
Yeah, last time I got off the stage, I looked Chester in the face
But now he gone and ain't no going back, uh

Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
Lately I've been sick of living and nobody knows how I'm really feeling
I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood dripping
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissing
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
It's highway to hell and everybody knew it
The fuck are we doing? I'm feeling like
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
